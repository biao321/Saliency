brief description of currently used algorithm

big framework:
1. use MRF to get candidate object segments
2. rank using CC

MRF:
1. compute patch-wise shortest path cost: patch distance is computed either by Euclidean distance
	of vector pixels or mean color distance
2. set background as certain part of boundary and use cost as foreground weight
	and also get a unified background mask
3. grid sampling patches, use superpixel covering current patch as current seed
4. set data term according to computed bg mask and seed affinity map (pair-wise cost to seed patch)
5. smoothness as color similarity between neighbor pixels

Composition cost is computed using non-weighted segment composition (ICCV 2011 paper: re-implement)
P.S. may modify CC computation using shorest-path-cost superpixel weight map (later try) 2011-10-1
