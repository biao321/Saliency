salientregiondetector
input: image
output: detection

0. set detection params
1. init
	segmentation
	compute pair-wise cost
2. run multi-sliding window
	for each window size, run slidingWindow and do nms
	do nms for all resulted windows from all scales
3. save data


SegmentBasedWindowComposer: compose one window or compute a scoremap for a window size
input: window, superpixel compose features (index map, segment static features, background weight image)


test stage: all ok
detector init: ok
detection: 
	1. non-incremental: OK, lack integral area count
	2. incremental: OK

Problem:
slow; bgmap can't save
